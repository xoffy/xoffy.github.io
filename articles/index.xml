      <description>Here is a list of some Russian loanwords found in Yakut/Sakha language.
Basically, you can use any Russian word in Yakut, since 99.9% of Yakuts who speak Yakut also can speak Russian, and they are often mix two languages. This is called code-switching, and every bilingual person knows how it feels.
Anyway, the lists on this page are not about that. The words presented here can be considered as an integral part of Yakut language.</description>
